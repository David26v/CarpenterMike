    story: `I‚Äôm an all-trades craftsman with over 30 years of experience. My work goes far beyond carpentry, as my photo gallery demonstrates. 
    I‚Äôve performed:
    ‚Ä¢ Remodels (changing the structure)
    ‚Ä¢ Renovations (restoring or updating)
    ‚Ä¢ Makeovers (cosmetic refreshing)

    I perform every aspect of the work‚Äîno subcontractors, no outside crews, except where licensed experts are required. From building custom cabinets to complete residential makeovers and commercial interior work, I personally ensure the job is done right. 

    I keep my operation small, with minimal overhead. That means fair pricing and personal attention you won‚Äôt get from larger companies.

    My entire portfolio consists of projects done in the United States. I‚Äôve now relocated to the beautiful city of Kelowna to bring that same experience and craftsmanship to this community. References can be provided.`
